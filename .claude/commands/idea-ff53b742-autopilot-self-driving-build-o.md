## REQUIREMENT

# Autopilot: self-driving build over the dependency graph

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (9/3)

## Description
Turn the advisory NBA engine into a project-wide executor. A computeGlobalBuildPlan() topologically sorts buildDependencyMap() against live feature statuses to find the critical path, then autonomously dispatches CLI fix tasks feature-by-feature (reusing the existing fix callback + harness), unblocking each layer until the whole matrix goes green � all watched from a live mission-control view. First sprint step: implement computeGlobalBuildPlan() (topo-sort + critical-path) and render the ordered, blocker-aware build queue in CrossModuleFeatureDashboard with a dry-run (no auto-dispatch yet).

## Reasoning
The dependency graph, per-feature statuses, fix dispatch, and harness loop all already exist as isolated pieces � wiring them into one autonomous loop is the difference between a tracker and a product that builds your game while you sleep. This is the signature, story-worthy capability that defines the category.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Feature Matrix & Next-Best-Action

**Description**: Cross-module feature dependency matrix, overlap detection, batch review, and the NBA (Next Best Action) engine that recommends what to build next. Backed by feature-matrix DB and feature-definitions graph.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
