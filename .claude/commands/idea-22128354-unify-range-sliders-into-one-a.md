## REQUIREMENT

# Unify range sliders into one a11y RangeSlider primitive

## Description
DamageCalcSection.SliderParam and GASBalanceSimulator StatInput each hand-roll a raw <input type=range> with a linear-gradient track and no custom thumb, focus ring, or ARIA � and the same pattern is duplicated across 28 files. Build a single @/components/ui/RangeSlider with styled ::-webkit-slider-thumb / ::-moz-range-thumb, a focus-visible ring, aria-label / aria-valuenow / aria-valuetext, and keyboard step support, then refactor the GAS sliders onto it first. This makes every slider feel premium and identical across the app instead of relying on inconsistent native OS thumbs.

## Reasoning
Sliders are the primary direct-manipulation control in the damage and balance tooling, so their rough, browser-default thumbs and missing keyboard/screen-reader support are felt constantly. One shared primitive fixes look, feel, and accessibility everywhere at once (build once, deploy 28 places) � classic design-system leverage.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: GAS Abilities, Damage & Balance

**Description**: Gameplay Ability System authoring: ability spellbook, ability forge (AI generation), GAS blueprint editor with C++ codegen, and the balance simulator that sweeps damage formulas across levels. Generates UE5 GameplayEffect/GameplayAbility code.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
