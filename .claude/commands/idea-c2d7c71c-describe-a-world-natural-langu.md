## REQUIREMENT

# Describe-a-world: natural-language zone authoring

## Description
Build a conversational interface where a non-technical designer types a plain-language brief (for example: a haunted swamp for level 15-20 with a corrupted druid boss and three side quests about lost villagers) and the system synthesizes the full LevelDesignDocument (zone topology, POIs, encounter density, playtime budget) AND the matching quest definitions via the existing quest-generation pipeline. It collapses the entire ZoneMap + quest toolchain into a single sentence. First sprint step: a prompt-builder that maps a free-text brief to the existing LevelDesignDocument and quest-generation JSON schema, rendering the result in the current ZoneMap views.

## Reasoning
Today building a zone requires understanding room graphs, difficulty arcs, spawn entries, and actor classification; natural-language authoring makes world-building accessible to anyone, directly serving the Globalization goal of non-technical usability. This is the magical, tell-your-friends capability that could define the product category. The visualization and generation backends already exist, so we are adding an intent layer on top of proven plumbing.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Quests & Zone Mapping

**Description**: Zone map topology with POI/encounter density, playtime estimation, travel progression, and the quest generator that produces quest definitions for the world.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
