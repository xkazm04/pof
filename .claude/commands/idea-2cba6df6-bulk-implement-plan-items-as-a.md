## REQUIREMENT

# Bulk-implement plan items as auto-generated DAG

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (5/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (9/3)
- **Scan Type**: feature_scout
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 12:41:34 PM

## Description
Add multi-select to ImplementationPlan.tsx; selected items become a WorkflowDefinition where node deps are derived from each feature's dependsOn array, then handed to the existing TaskDAGOrchestrator. Bridges the Plan (knows the order) and the Orchestrator (can execute) which are currently disconnected. Surface progress inline in the plan view so users do not have to switch to WorkflowOrchestratorView.

## Reasoning
Today a user clicks "Implement This" one row at a time, or runs a module-scoped template that ignores cross-module dep order. Linear/Jira bulk actions and GitHub Actions DAG workflows both demonstrate the step-change from this kind of batched, dependency-respecting execution. The data model, validateWorkflow, and orchestrator are already in place � this is the single missing bridge that unlocks the whole stack.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Implementation Planning & Roadmap

**Description**: Generates implementation plans (effort/impact scoring, DAG layout), milestone deadlines, workflow-DAG orchestration, and roadmap/calendar views. Backed by taskDAGStore.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
