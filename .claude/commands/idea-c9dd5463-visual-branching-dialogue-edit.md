## REQUIREMENT

# Visual branching dialogue editor (Twine/Yarn style)

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (8/3)
- **Scan Type**: feature_scout
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 4:01:27 PM

## Description
Add a node-graph editor for the DialogueNode trees that quest-generator.ts produces. Render speakers, text, and choices as draggable nodes with bezier edges, edit text inline, add/remove branches, and condition flags. Persist edits back to the GeneratedQuest.dialogue array. Stack: react-flow (already an ecosystem standard) over the existing DialogueNode/DialogueChoice types in src/types/quest-generation.ts.

## Reasoning
Twine, Yarn Spinner, Ink, and articy:draft are the de-facto narrative tools for indie+AAA RPGs because flat text scripts hide branch shape. The generator currently outputs flat 3-node trees no designer would ship; a visual editor turns auto-generated stubs into real authoring artifacts and unlocks branching beyond accept/decline. One step further: AI-suggest sibling branches based on quest objectives + giver archetype.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Quests & Zone Mapping

**Description**: Zone map topology with POI/encounter density, playtime estimation, travel progression, and the quest generator that produces quest definitions for the world.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
