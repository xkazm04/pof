## REQUIREMENT

# Critical-path dependency graph visualization

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (6/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Scan Type**: feature_scout
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 4:48:07 PM

## Description
feature-definitions.ts already builds a full transitive dependency map (buildDependencyMap) with blockers and chains, but it is only surfaced as per-row blocked badges. Add a visual DAG view that renders features as nodes, dependency edges between them, and highlights the longest blocking chain (critical path) across the whole project. Color nodes by FeatureStatus and let clicking a node jump to its module, reusing computeBlockers for live status.

## Reasoning
Build-order tools like Jira Advanced Roadmaps, MS Project, and Linear dependency views prove that seeing the critical path is how teams decide sequencing and spot bottlenecks. The graph data is already computed; only a rendering layer (e.g. a force or layered layout) is new. It transforms the implicit aRPG curriculum order into an explorable map of what unblocks what.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Feature Matrix & Next-Best-Action

**Description**: Cross-module feature dependency matrix, overlap detection, batch review, and the NBA (Next Best Action) engine that recommends what to build next. Backed by feature-matrix DB and feature-definitions graph.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
