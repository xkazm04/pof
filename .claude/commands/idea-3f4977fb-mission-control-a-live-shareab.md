## REQUIREMENT

# Mission Control: a live, shareable build command center

## Metadata
- **Category**: ui
- **Effort**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Scan Type**: moonshot_architect
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 6:23:27 PM

## Description
Compose the existing ImplementationPlan, CalendarRoadmapView, and WorkflowOrchestratorView into one cinematic real-time 'Mission Control' screen, then expose it as a read-only public link so collaborators, stakeholders, or an audience can watch a game build itself node-by-node in real time. A live headline ('142 of 200 features done, demo in 9 days, 2 agents building now') anchors the view. First sprint step: build a unified read-only dashboard route that composes the three existing views with a single live progress headline derived from project-progress and the active WorkflowExecution.

## Reasoning
A public, live 'watch the game build itself' dashboard is inherently shareable and gives the product a signature, demo-able identity that attracts users, talent, and investment. It also makes progress legible to non-technical stakeholders who would never open the engineer-facing tabs. It reuses three views that already exist, so the leap is the unifying frame and shareability.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Implementation Planning & Roadmap

**Description**: Generates implementation plans (effort/impact scoring, DAG layout), milestone deadlines, workflow-DAG orchestration, and roadmap/calendar views. Backed by taskDAGStore.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
