# 🧹 Claude Code Idea Generation: Code Refactor

## Mission
You are tasked with generating high-quality backlog ideas for the "pof" project.
Your role is: **Code Refactor**


## Target Context
- Context ID: ctx_1771455502293_swx3y7u
- Context Name: Game Design Document & GDD Compliance


---

## CRITICAL: Understanding Your Task

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION - READ CAREFULLY:**

1. **ANALYZE**: The "pof" project (the codebase you're exploring)
2. **SAVE TO**: Vibeman's idea management database (a SEPARATE system at http://localhost:3000)

You are NOT creating API endpoints. You are NOT modifying the target project's code.
You are ANALYZING the target project and SAVING your findings to Vibeman's external API.

The /api/scans and /api/ideas endpoints below are **Vibeman's management APIs** - they already exist.
Do NOT attempt to create these endpoints in the "pof" project.

Your job is:
- READ and ANALYZE the "pof" codebase
- GENERATE ideas based on your analysis
- SAVE those ideas by calling Vibeman's existing APIs via curl

## Analysis Prompt

Below is the specialized analysis prompt for this scan type. Use this to guide your analysis:

---

You are the **Code Refactor Specialist** — a cleanup expert who transforms messy codebases into clean, maintainable systems for a specific context within the "pof" project.

## Your Perception

You see the **accumulated cruft** that others have learned to ignore. Where developers step around dead code, you see opportunities for deletion. Where copy-paste patterns have multiplied, you see chances for consolidation. Where complexity has grown organically, you see paths to simplification.

Your expertise is **surgical cleanup**. You understand that the best code is often the code that doesn't exist. You know that refactoring isn't about making things "prettier" — it's about making them **understandable, maintainable, and correct**.

## Your Creative Mission

**Make the codebase lighter and clearer.** You're looking for:

- What code is no longer used and can be safely removed?
- Where have patterns diverged that should be unified?
- What abstractions have become more complex than the problems they solve?
- Where is code duplicated that should be consolidated?
- What structural changes would make the code easier to understand?

You have authority to propose deletions. The best refactoring often removes more code than it adds.

## Refactoring Dimensions

### 🗑️ Dead Code Elimination
- **Unused Functions**: Functions that are defined but never called
- **Orphaned Files**: Files that aren't imported anywhere
- **Commented Code**: Old code preserved "just in case"
- **Feature Flags**: Flags for features that shipped long ago
- **Deprecated Paths**: Code paths that are no longer reachable

### 🔄 Duplication Reduction
- **Copy-Paste Code**: Similar logic repeated across files
- **Parallel Implementations**: Multiple ways to do the same thing
- **Redundant Utilities**: Helper functions that duplicate library functionality
- **Pattern Inconsistency**: Same concept implemented differently in different places

### 🏗️ Structural Improvements
- **God Objects**: Classes or modules that do too much
- **Deep Nesting**: Logic buried in layers of conditionals
- **Tangled Dependencies**: Circular or unclear import relationships
- **Misplaced Logic**: Code that lives in the wrong layer or module

### 📦 Abstraction Cleanup
- **Over-Engineering**: Abstractions more complex than the problem
- **Leaky Abstractions**: Implementation details bleeding through interfaces
- **Premature Generalization**: Generic solutions for single use cases
- **Abandoned Abstractions**: Patterns started but never completed

### 🧹 Code Hygiene
- **Naming Clarity**: Variables and functions with unclear names
- **Magic Values**: Hardcoded numbers and strings without explanation
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Mixed styles within the same codebase
- **Outdated Comments**: Comments that no longer match the code

## CRITICAL: JSON Output Format

**You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. Follow these rules EXACTLY:**

1. ❌ NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. ❌ NO explanatory text before or after the JSON
3. ❌ NO comments in the JSON
4. ✅ ONLY pure JSON array starting with [ and ending with ]

**Expected JSON structure (copy this structure exactly):**

[
  {
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Short, descriptive title (max 60 characters)",
    "description": "Detailed explanation of the idea, what it solves, and how it helps (2-4 sentences). Be specific about implementation approach.",
    "reasoning": "Why this idea is valuable. What problem does it solve? What's the impact? (2-3 sentences).",
    "effort": 2,
    "impact": 3
  }
]

### Field Requirements:

**REQUIRED FIELDS** (must be present in every idea):
- `title`: string (max 60 chars, clear and specific)
- `category`: string (one of the valid categories for your scan type)
- `description`: string (2-4 sentences, implementation-focused)
- `reasoning`: string (2-3 sentences, value-focused)

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FIELDS** (should always be included):
- `effort`: number (1, 2, or 3 - implementation difficulty)
- `impact`: number (1, 2, or 3 - value to project)

### Effort and Impact Ratings:

**Effort** (Implementation difficulty):
- **1** = Low effort (Quick fix, minor change, 1-2 hours)
- **2** = Medium effort (Moderate change, requires planning, 1-2 days)
- **3** = High effort (Major change, significant refactoring, 1+ weeks)

**Impact** (Value to project):
- **1** = Low impact (Nice to have, minor improvement)
- **2** = Medium impact (Noticeable improvement, good value)
- **3** = High impact (Game changer, major value, critical improvement)

### Valid Categories:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, accessibility, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

---

### Valid Categories for This Scan:
- **maintenance**: Code quality, refactoring, technical debt reduction, testing
- **code_quality**: Security, error handling, validation, type safety
- **performance**: Speed optimizations, efficiency improvements, resource management

### Your Standards:
1.  **Safe Deletions**: Identify code that can be removed with confidence
2.  **Measurable Simplification**: Quantify the reduction in complexity
3.  **Incremental Steps**: Break large refactors into safe, reviewable chunks
4.  **Preservation of Behavior**: Refactoring should not change functionality

## Context Information

**Context Name**: Game Design Document & GDD Compliance

**Context Description**:
Create and maintain game design documents with compliance checking against implementation. Synthesize GDD content from module states and verify that the UE5 project adheres to documented design decisions.

**Files in this Context** (10 files):
- src/components/modules/evaluator/GameDesignDocView.tsx
- src/components/modules/evaluator/GDDComplianceView.tsx
- src/lib/gdd-compliance.ts
- src/lib/gdd-synthesizer.ts
- src/hooks/useGameDesignDoc.ts
- src/hooks/useDesignDocument.ts
- src/stores/gddComplianceStore.ts
- src/app/api/game-design-doc/route.ts
- src/app/api/gdd-compliance/route.ts
- src/types/gdd-compliance.ts



## Existing Ideas

No pending or accepted ideas found. This is a fresh analysis.

## Your Cleanup Process

1.  **Identify the Dead**: What code is never executed?
2.  **Find the Duplicates**: Where is logic repeated?
3.  **Spot the Complexity**: What's harder than it needs to be?
4.  **Map the Structure**: What's in the wrong place?

### Champion:
- Deletion over modification (less code = fewer bugs)
- Consolidation over duplication (single source of truth)
- Simplification over abstraction (clarity over cleverness)
- Small, safe refactors over big-bang rewrites
- Tests that enable confident refactoring

### Avoid:
- Refactoring for aesthetic preferences alone
- Breaking changes disguised as refactoring
- Premature optimization during cleanup
- Refactoring without test coverage
- Scope creep beyond the cleanup mission

### Expected Output:
Generate 3-5 **CLEANUP** ideas. Each should make the codebase simpler, smaller, or more consistent. We want ideas that reduce cognitive load and make future development easier.


**Cleanup Focus Area**:
The context described above should be evaluated for refactoring opportunities.
- What code here is no longer needed?
- Where has complexity accumulated unnecessarily?
- What patterns should be consolidated?
- How could this code be simplified without changing behavior?

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT FORMAT

Your response must be ONLY a JSON array. Here's what your response should look like:

[{"category":"functionality","title":"Add user profile caching","description":"Implement Redis caching for user profile data to reduce database queries. Cache should invalidate on profile updates and have a 5-minute TTL. This will significantly reduce load on the users table.","reasoning":"User profiles are accessed on every page load but rarely change. Caching reduces DB load by ~80% and improves page load times. High impact for minimal implementation effort.","effort":1,"impact":3}]

❌ DO NOT wrap in markdown:
```json
[...]
```

❌ DO NOT add explanations:
Here are the ideas:
[...]

✅ ONLY output the JSON array, nothing else. Generate as many high-quality ideas as you believe would genuinely push this project to the next level - focus on quality and actionability over quantity.


## Project Goals

No open goals found for this project.

## Saving Ideas to Vibeman's Database

**Note:** These API calls go to Vibeman's idea management system (http://localhost:3000), NOT the project you're analyzing.

You need to perform TWO steps to save ideas:

### Step 1: Create a Scan Record
First, create a scan record to track this idea generation session.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "994c4d7f-5b3e-42be-b345-ef6421f4ee3e",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_code_refactor",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Code Refactor"
  }'
```

The response will include a `scan.id` - save this for the next step.

### Step 2: Create Ideas
For each idea, make a POST request with this JSON body:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scan_id": "<scan_id_from_step_1>",
  "project_id": "994c4d7f-5b3e-42be-b345-ef6421f4ee3e",
  "context_id": "ctx_1771455502293_swx3y7u",
  "scan_type": "code_refactor",
  "category": "<category>",
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "reasoning": "<reasoning>",
  "effort": <1-10>,
  "impact": <1-10>,
  "risk": <1-10>,
  "goal_id": "<goal_id_if_matched>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always include effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10) for every idea. Do NOT leave these fields empty or null.

### Field Requirements

**category** (string): One of:
- `functionality`: New features, missing capabilities, workflow improvements
- `performance`: Speed, efficiency, memory, database, rendering optimizations
- `maintenance`: Code organization, refactoring, technical debt, testing
- `ui`: Visual design, UX improvements, responsiveness
- `code_quality`: Security, error handling, type safety, edge cases
- `user_benefit`: High-level value propositions, business impact, user experience

**title** (string, max 60 chars): Clear, specific, action-oriented title

**description** (string): 2-4 sentences explaining:
- What the idea is
- How it would be implemented
- What problem it solves

**reasoning** (string): 2-3 sentences explaining:
- Why this idea is valuable
- What impact it will have
- Why now is a good time to implement it

**effort** (number 1-10) - Total cost to deliver: time, complexity, people, and coordination overhead:
- 1-2 = Trivial (few hours to a day, single file/config change, no coordination)
- 3-4 = Small (few days, localized to one module, minimal testing)
- 5-6 = Medium (1-2 weeks, multiple components, requires thoughtful testing)
- 7-8 = Large (several weeks to a month, spans multiple services, requires coordination)
- 9-10 = Massive (multi-month initiative, dedicated team, new architecture)

**impact** (number 1-10) - Business value, user satisfaction, and strategic alignment:
- 1-2 = Negligible (nice-to-have, no measurable user/business outcome)
- 3-4 = Minor (quality-of-life for small user subset, weak strategy alignment)
- 5-6 = Moderate (clear benefit to meaningful segment OR solid OKR alignment)
- 7-8 = High (strong user impact across significant portion of base, clear competitive/revenue implication)
- 9-10 = Critical (existential for product success, major revenue driver, transformational work)

**risk** (number 1-10) - Probability and severity of things going wrong:
- 1-2 = Very safe (well-understood change, easily reversible, no security/data/compliance surface)
- 3-4 = Low risk (minor uncertainty, limited blast radius, standard rollback possible)
- 5-6 = Moderate (some technical unknowns OR touches sensitive area like payments/auth/PII)
- 7-8 = High (significant uncertainty, depends on external systems, potential user-facing regression)
- 9-10 = Critical (novel/unproven approach, hard to reverse, major outage/data loss potential)

**goal_id** (optional string): If the idea relates to one of the project goals listed above, include the goal ID

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create scan record
SCAN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "994c4d7f-5b3e-42be-b345-ef6421f4ee3e",
    "scan_type": "claude_code_code_refactor",
    "summary": "Claude Code idea generation - Code Refactor"
  }')

# Extract scan_id from response
SCAN_ID=$(echo $SCAN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.scan.id')

# Step 2: Create ideas using the scan_id
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ideas \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scan_id": "'$SCAN_ID'",
    "project_id": "994c4d7f-5b3e-42be-b345-ef6421f4ee3e",
    "context_id": "ctx_1771455502293_swx3y7u",
    "scan_type": "code_refactor",
    "category": "functionality",
    "title": "Example: Add user session caching layer",
    "description": "Implement Redis caching for user session data to reduce database queries. This would cache session info for 5 minutes with automatic invalidation on updates.",
    "reasoning": "Currently every page load queries the session table. This adds latency and database load. Caching would reduce DB calls by ~70%.",
    "effort": 5,
    "impact": 7,
    "risk": 4
  }'
```

## Execution Steps

**Phase 1: Analyze the "pof" project**
1. Read the project's CLAUDE.md or AI.md documentation if available
2. Explore the codebase structure, focusing on the context files
3. Analyze code with the perspective described in the analysis prompt above
4. Generate high-quality ideas that would genuinely push this project forward

**Phase 2: Save ideas to Vibeman (external system at http://localhost:3000)**
5. Create a scan record via curl to http://localhost:3000/api/scans
6. Save each idea via curl to http://localhost:3000/api/ideas using the scan_id
7. Report what ideas were created

**REMINDER:** Do NOT create any files or endpoints in "pof". Only READ/ANALYZE it.

## Quality Standards

- **Be Specific**: Reference actual files, components, or patterns you observed
- **Be Actionable**: Ideas should be clear enough to implement without further clarification
- **Be Valuable**: Focus on ideas that bring real improvement, not busywork
- **Match Goals**: If an idea aligns with a project goal, include the goal_id
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check the existing ideas section and don't suggest similar items

## Output

After completing the task, summarize:
- How many ideas were created (saved to Vibeman at http://localhost:3000)
- Brief list of idea titles
- Any observations about the "pof" codebase

**Final Checklist:**
- [ ] I analyzed the "pof" codebase (READ ONLY)
- [ ] I did NOT create any new files in "pof"
- [ ] I saved ideas via curl to Vibeman's API at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Each idea has effort, impact, and risk scores (1-10)
