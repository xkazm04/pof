## REQUIREMENT

# Self-balancing encounters via mass simulated playtests

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (9/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (8/3)
- **Scan Type**: moonshot_architect
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 5:22:26 PM

## Description
Build on the AITestingSandbox run infrastructure to fire thousands of headless simulated fights across player skill and gear profiles, derive the real difficulty curve, flag spikes and dead zones, and auto-suggest concrete stat/wave edits. Results overlay onto the existing DifficultyChart so designers see predicted time-to-kill and player-death-rate per wave and accept fixes with one click.

## Reasoning
Difficulty tuning is currently guesswork against hand-authored curves; a system that playtests itself thousands of times and proposes balance fixes is a category-defining capability no competitor offers. Each recorded simulation compounds into a better balance model over time, creating a durable data moat.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Enemy Bestiary & AI Behavior

**Description**: Enemy archetype builder, behavior-tree flowcharts, perception/aggro tuning, encounter difficulty, and the AI testing sandbox that runs simulated playtests. Backed by ai-testing DB + useAITesting.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
