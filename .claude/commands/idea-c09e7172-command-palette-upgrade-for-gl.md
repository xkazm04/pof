## REQUIREMENT

# Command palette upgrade for GlobalSearchPanel

## Metadata
- **Category**: ui
- **Effort**: Unknown (5/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (8/3)
- **Scan Type**: ui_perfectionist
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 3:42:31 PM

## Description
The Ctrl+K palette currently shows only static help text on open ('Type to search�'). Pre-populate the empty state with three useful sections � 'Recent' (last 5 results clicked, persisted to localStorage), 'Jump to module' (top 4 most-visited modules via navigationStore stats), and 'Actions' ('Open setup wizard', 'Reindex', 'Toggle activity feed') � each as keyboard-navigable rows using the existing SearchResultRow shape. Add subtle category dividers (text-2xs uppercase tracking-wider text-text-muted, py-1 px-4 bg-background/40) and a fade-in stagger on first paint (Framer 'when: beforeChildren', staggerChildren: 0.02).

## Reasoning
Raycast, Linear, and Superhuman set the bar � opening a palette into an empty state is now perceived as broken or unfinished. Showing recents + jumps makes the palette useful before the user even types and dramatically increases its perceived value as a navigation tool, not just search.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Application Shell & Project Setup

**Description**: Root layout, app shell with L1/L2 sidebars, top bar, module renderer, global search, and activity feed; plus the project-setup wizard (create/select UE project, path browser). Backed by projectStore, navigationStore, moduleStore.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
