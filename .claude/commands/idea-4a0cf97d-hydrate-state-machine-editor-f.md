## REQUIREMENT

# Hydrate State Machine Editor from AnimBP scan

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (5/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (8/3)
- **Scan Type**: feature_scout
- **Generated**: 5/24/2026, 11:54:01 AM

## Description
Wire the existing scan-animbp route output (AnimInstance class, states, transitions, montageRefs) into StateMachineEditor via a Load from Project button that maps AnimBPScanResult to EditorState[]/EditorTransition[] with auto-layout. The editor currently always boots from hardcoded DEFAULT_STATES, ignoring the real project. Once loaded, the existing snapshot/diff machinery shows exactly what diverges from the shipped C++.

## Reasoning
This closes the scan to edit to generate loop the way Prisma introspects an existing DB into an editable schema and Postman imports an OpenAPI spec. Today the scanner and the visual editor are disconnected, so designers edit a fiction instead of their actual state machine. Reusing data structures both sides already define makes this high impact for medium effort.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Animation State Graphs & Montages

**Description**: Authors UE5 animation: state machine/graph editor, combo montages with frame scrubber, blend-space budget, retargeting, Mixamo import, and AI combo choreographer. Scans AnimBP assets and emits animation code.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
