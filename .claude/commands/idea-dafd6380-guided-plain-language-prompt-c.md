## Description
Variant authoring today is a raw monospace textarea in PromptEvolutionView — opaque to anyone who does not already know UE5 prompt conventions. Build a step-by-step composer mapped to PromptBuilder's six sections, each posed as a plain-language question ("What should the AI build?", "How will you know it worked?") with inline examples and tooltips that translate UE jargon (GAS, ASC, montage). The wizard assembles a structured prompt through the existing PromptBuilder. Push further with an "Explain this prompt" mode that annotates any existing prompt section-by-section in plain English.

## Reasoning
Typeform, Notion templates, and Zapier's plain-English builders prove that guided, jargon-free authoring dramatically widens who can use a tool. This directly serves the Globalization goal of being understandable by day-to-day non-technical users, and reuses the already-enforced 6-section PromptBuilder architecture so the output stays well-formed.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Prompt Builder, Knowledge & Evolution

**Description**: Composable prompt-builder with project-context header and module-registry checklists, UE knowledge packs (gotchas, known-assets, wiring), and the prompt-evolution engine (A/B testing, clustering, mutations) with the pattern library.
**Related Files**:
- `src/lib/prompts/prompt-builder.ts`
- `src/lib/prompt-context.ts`
- `src/lib/module-registry.ts`

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
