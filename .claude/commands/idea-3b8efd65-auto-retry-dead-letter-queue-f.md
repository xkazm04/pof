## REQUIREMENT

# Auto-retry & dead-letter queue for stuck runs

## Metadata

## Description
dispatchHealth.ts already detects the stuck/hung failure class (in-flight > 15m) and the task registry marks stale tasks failed after 10m, but neither does anything about it, and resolveCallback in cli-task.ts silently loses a result if the POST throws. Add a retry policy: failed callbacks retry with exponential backoff, stuck dispatches can auto-resubmit by RESUMING the session (not restarting), and runs that exhaust retries land in a visible dead-letter list for one-click manual replay.

## Reasoning
Background-job systems (Sidekiq, BullMQ, Temporal) made retry-with-backoff plus a dead-letter queue the table-stakes answer to transient failures because losing work silently is unacceptable. The SP-A/SP-B hang the codebase already fought proves these failures are real and expensive here. Turning passive observability into active remediation converts silent 40-minute losses into self-healing runs.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Claude CLI Terminal & Task System

**Description**: Spawns the Claude Code CLI, parses stream-json output with session management, and drives the unified CLITask abstraction (checklist/fix/review/scan) via @@CALLBACK markers. Surfaced through inline/compact terminals and useModuleCLI.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
