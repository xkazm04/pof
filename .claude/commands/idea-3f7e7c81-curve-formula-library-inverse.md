## Description
ProgressionCurve currently exposes only baseXp and a single power exponent via generateChartData. Add a library of named curve shapes (linear, quadratic, exponential, logistic/S-curve, Fibonacci, and table-driven piecewise) plus an inverse solver: the designer enters a goal such as reach max level in ~40 hours at 300 XP/min and the tool back-solves the parameters and feeds them into the live estimator. Inspired by Desmos curve fitting and Machinations economy design.

## Reasoning
Real RPGs rarely use one pure power curve; designers expect to pick a shape and to design backward from a target play-time, which no current control allows. An inverse solver converts the editor from trial-and-error slider nudging into intentional pacing design and makes the XP table generator and danger-zone analysis far more credible. The math is self-contained and reuses existing chart plumbing.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Genome Editing & Progression Curves

**Description**: Procedural character/item DNA (genome) editors with C++ codegen, attribute-point optimizer, and the XP/power progression curve designer with build comparison and time-to-level estimation. Includes genre-evolution engine and genomeStore.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
