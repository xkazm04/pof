## REQUIREMENT

# Interactive perception tuner with live coverage

## Metadata

## Description
PerceptionConeViz hardcodes a 60-degree / 1500cm sight cone and 800cm hearing radius as a static diagram. Convert it into a live tuner: sliders for sight angle, sight radius, peripheral falloff, and hearing radius that redraw the SVG in real time and recompute which DETECTED_ENTITIES flip between In sight / Heard / Undetected. Add a Copy AIPerception config button that emits the matching UAISenseConfig_Sight/Hearing C++ setup.

## Reasoning
Unreal's own AI Perception workflow and stealth-design tooling prove that designers tune detection by dragging cones and watching coverage, not by editing numbers blind. Turning a read-only illustration into a what-if tuner with instant detection feedback and copyable config makes the panel an actual design instrument. Effort is contained because the SVG geometry and entity model already exist.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Enemy Bestiary & AI Behavior

**Description**: Enemy archetype builder, behavior-tree flowcharts, perception/aggro tuning, encounter difficulty, and the AI testing sandbox that runs simulated playtests. Backed by ai-testing DB + useAITesting.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
