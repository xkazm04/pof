## Description
After SetupWizard completes, users are dropped straight into a dense shell (L1/L2 sidebars, CLI terminal, activity feed, evaluator) with only a bare Welcome to POF empty state to orient them. Borrow the onboarding pattern from Linear, Notion, and Figma: a dismissible getting-started panel plus lightweight coach-marks that point at the category rail, the CLI terminal, the search bar, and the first recommended action. Persist completion per project so it never reappears, and let users re-open the tour from a Help menu.

## Reasoning
The project goal is that the app is understandable by day-to-day non-technical users, and a guided first run is the single most proven lever for that. It converts the steep mental model of categories, modules, and CLI tasks into a narrated path, reducing abandonment in the critical first session and making the existing power features actually get used.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Application Shell & Project Setup

**Description**: Root layout, app shell with L1/L2 sidebars, top bar, module renderer, global search, and activity feed; plus the project-setup wizard (create/select UE project, path browser). Backed by projectStore, navigationStore, moduleStore.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
