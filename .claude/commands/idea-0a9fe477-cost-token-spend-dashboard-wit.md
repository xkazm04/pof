## REQUIREMENT

# Cost & token spend dashboard with budget guards

## Metadata
- **Category**: user_benefit
- **Effort**: Unknown (5/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Scan Type**: feature_scout

## Description
The CLI already captures cost_usd and input/output tokens in the result event (cli-service.ts) and session-manager has totalCostUsd/totalTokensIn/Out fields, but nothing aggregates or shows them. Surface a spend dashboard: cost and tokens per run, rolled up per module and per task type, with a daily/monthly budget meter. Add a pre-flight guardrail that warns before launching a task type known to be expensive (live editor runs, module scans).

## Reasoning
Cursor usage analytics, the Claude Code /cost view, and OpenAI dashboards all exist because users running paid agents need to see and cap spend. The data is already flowing through PoF and being thrown away. One step further than a raw usage meter: pair cost against checklist items completed to show per-module ROI, so the user can see which game systems are cheap vs expensive to build.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Claude CLI Terminal & Task System

**Description**: Spawns the Claude Code CLI, parses stream-json output with session management, and drives the unified CLITask abstraction (checklist/fix/review/scan) via @@CALLBACK markers. Surfaced through inline/compact terminals and useModuleCLI.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
