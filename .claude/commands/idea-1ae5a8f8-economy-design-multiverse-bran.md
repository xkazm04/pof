## REQUIREMENT

# Economy design multiverse: branch, diff & compare

## Metadata
- **Category**: ui
- **Effort**: Unknown (6/3)
- **Impact**: Unknown (7/3)
- **Scan Type**: moonshot_architect

## Description
Make every config+result a saveable, shareable node so designers can branch hundreds of what-if economy variants and view them side by side, diffing power curves, Gini trajectories, and alert sets in one comparison panel (git-for-game-balance). First step: define a serializable economy snapshot (config plus key result metrics), persist it via a small store/localStorage, and build a two-up comparison view that reuses the existing power-curve and alerts charts. Can leverage the project's existing deflate+base64url build-code pattern for shareable variant codes.

## Reasoning
Balancing is inherently comparative ('is loot-driven better than scarcity here?') yet today each run overwrites the last, so insight evaporates. A versioned multiverse with visual diffs makes tradeoffs legible and decisions defensible, transforming one-shot experiments into a durable, sharable design knowledge base.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Item Economy & Balance Simulation

**Description**: Item-economy simulator: models drop rates, currency sinks/faucets, and rarity stacking; generates economy-tuning C++ and surfaces affix alerts. Backed by economy-simulator API and economySimulatorStore.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
