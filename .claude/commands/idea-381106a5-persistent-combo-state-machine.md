## REQUIREMENT

# Persistent combo & state machine library

## Metadata
- **Category**: user_benefit

## Description
Both StateMachineEditor and AIComboChoreographer hold work in local useState, so navigating away discards it. Add a saved-asset library backed by the apps better-sqlite3 store (new CRUD API route) to name, tag, browse, duplicate, and reload combos and state machines. One step further: saved combos become selectable montages inside FrameScrubberPanel and EventTimelinePanel.

## Reasoning
Every serious creation tool from Postman collections to Figma component libraries treats saved work as first-class reusable assets, and users are jarred when a tool silently loses their input. Persisting to the existing SQLite layer turns one-shot generators into an iterative workflow and feeds the visualization panels, multiplying the value of work already produced.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Animation State Graphs & Montages

**Description**: Authors UE5 animation: state machine/graph editor, combo montages with frame scrubber, blend-space budget, retargeting, Mixamo import, and AI combo choreographer. Scans AnimBP assets and emits animation code.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

Use Claude Code skills as appropriate for implementation guidance. Check `.claude/skills/` directory for available skills.

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
