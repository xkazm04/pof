## REQUIREMENT

# Closed-loop world synthesis to live UE5 assets

## Metadata
- **Category**: functionality
- **Effort**: Unknown (9/3)

## Description
Today generateQuests produces JSON definitions that never leave the planner. The moonshot is to close the loop: emit UE5 Python and Blueprint scripts so a generated quest or zone becomes real in-engine content automatically (Quest DataTable rows, dialogue assets, level streaming volumes, navmesh-validated zone connections, spawn placement). Combined with the existing CLI/Python bridge, the ZoneMap becomes a one-click world builder, not just a blueprint. First sprint step: generate a single UE5 Python script from one GeneratedQuest that creates a Quest DataTable row and prints it for review.

## Reasoning
The gap between a beautiful plan and a playable world is where most game tools stop and most value is lost; closing it makes PoF the rare tool that builds, not just diagrams. This compounds with every other generator in the app and creates a defensible moat around end-to-end automation. The Python bridge already exists, making the first asset-emission step low-risk and immediately demoable.

## Context

**Note**: This section provides supporting architectural documentation and is NOT a hard requirement. Use it as guidance to understand existing code structure and maintain consistency.

### Context: Quests & Zone Mapping

**Description**: Zone map topology with POI/encounter density, playtime estimation, travel progression, and the quest generator that produces quest definitions for the world.

**Post-Implementation**: After completing this requirement, evaluate if the context description or file paths need updates. Use the appropriate API/DB query to update the context if architectural changes were made.

## Recommended Skills

- **compact-ui-design**: Use `.claude/skills/compact-ui-design.md` for high-quality UI design references and patterns

## Notes

This requirement was generated from an AI-evaluated project idea. No specific goal is associated with this idea.

## DURING IMPLEMENTATION

- Use `get_memory` MCP tool when you encounter unfamiliar code or need context about patterns/files
- Use `report_progress` MCP tool at each major phase (analyzing, planning, implementing, testing, validating)
- Use `get_related_tasks` MCP tool before modifying shared files to check for parallel task conflicts

## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. Log your implementation using the `log_implementation` MCP tool with:
   - requirementName: the requirement filename (without .md)
   - title: 2-6 word summary
   - overview: 1-2 paragraphs describing what was done
   - category: one of feature/bugfix/refactor/performance/security/infrastructure/ui/docs/test
   - patternsApplied: comma-separated patterns used (e.g. "repository pattern, debounce, memoization")

2. Check for test scenario using `check_test_scenario` MCP tool
   - If hasScenario is true, call `capture_screenshot` tool
   - If hasScenario is false, skip screenshot

3. Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` (fix any type errors)

Begin implementation now.
