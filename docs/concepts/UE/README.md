# UE concepts & followups

Durable, future-session-oriented notes for PoF's **Unreal Engine integration** —
the autonomy/tooling work that turns UE into something PoF can drive headlessly and
verify. Unlike `docs/superpowers/specs/` (per-change design artifacts) these are the
**maintained reference**: what exists, how to drive it, the hard-won recipes, and the
open followups a future session should pick up.

## Contents

| Doc | Covers |
|-----|--------|
| [l4-autonomous-visual-capture.md](l4-autonomous-visual-capture.md) | The L4 visual-verification gate: how PoF autonomously launches headless UE 5.8, renders a frame, and feeds it to the Gemini check — the architecture, the proven headless-launch recipe + gotchas, what works, and the open content gap. |
| [mcp-parity-audit.md](mcp-parity-audit.md) | The Phase 3 #1 coverage audit: per-candidate verdicts (Epic-COVERED / GAP / residual) deciding what to port to `PoFToolset` vs drop — and the one C++-bound retire blocker (`anim_blueprint`). |
| [mcp-bakeoff-verdict.md](mcp-bakeoff-verdict.md) | The Phase 3 #1 retirement bake-off: coverage-parity map + live `:8000` vs `:8090` spot-checks + rubric → **retire `MCPUnreal`+Go, gated on re-homing `anim_blueprint` as C++**. |
| [go-cpp-stack-decommission.md](go-cpp-stack-decommission.md) | The descope: what's done (config-level — `.mcp.json` flipped to `:8000`), the **manual** physical-removal steps (UE plugin + Go binary), and the **deferred** `anim_blueprint` C++ re-home. |
| [sword-lifecycle-battle-plan.md](sword-lifecycle-battle-plan.md) | **Plan (not started)** — drive a sword concept→2D→3D→equip→attack→hit/damage into the live UE project on the converged stack. MVP the raw process first, then wire each step to PoF UI/API. The "prove the tooling end-to-end → autonomous game dev" use case 1. |
| [followups.md](followups.md) | The running backlog of UE-side followups for future sessions (L4 content gap, Phase 2 long-tail tools, RefreshTools measurement, lit-map alignment, …). |
