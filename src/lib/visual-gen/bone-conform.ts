/**
 * Bone-hierarchy conform — matching a GENERATED rig's bone names to the names an existing
 * animation library expects.
 *
 * ── The problem, concretely ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A rigged mesh and a clip are bound by bone NAME. Every retarget path PoF touches works
 * that way: UE's IK Retargeter maps chains by name, Blender's armature action assignment
 * matches by name, and a third-party clip library ships names from whatever skeleton it was
 * authored against. So a perfectly good auto-rig plus a perfectly good clip produce nothing
 * when the two vocabularies disagree — which is the normal case, not the exception, because
 * the rigger and the clip author never coordinated.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do is apply the renames: that is an armature edit, and it
 * belongs in the Blender pass specified in `docs/research/bone-hierarchy-conform-spec.md`.
 * What it does is decide, deterministically and for free, WHAT the renames should be and
 * whether the conform is viable at all — the part that otherwise gets done by hand, or by
 * an LLM guessing at a bone list.
 *
 * ── Why normalization gets most of the way ───────────────────────────────────
 * The three vocabularies PoF actually handles differ mostly in DECORATION, not in meaning:
 *
 *   mixamorig:LeftUpLeg   ·   thigh_l   ·   LeftThigh
 *   mixamorig:LeftHand    ·   hand_l    ·   LeftHand
 *
 * Strip the vendor prefix, fold case, drop separators and index digits, and normalize the
 * side marker to a canonical position, and a large share of pairs collapse onto the same
 * key. That is a deterministic, explainable match — no model, no guessing — and it leaves a
 * short residue of genuinely ambiguous bones for a human or an LLM to decide, which is a far
 * better shape than handing the whole skeleton to a model and hoping.
 *
 * ── The hard limit, stated up front ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * An anonymously-named rig (`bone_0…bone_N`, which is what skin-tokens.cpp produces — see
 * `skeleton-profiles.ts`) cannot be conformed by name at all: there is no meaning to match.
 * {@link planConform} reports that as a blocker rather than a 0% match, because the fix is
 * categorically different — such a rig needs joints identified from their POSITIONS in the
 * mesh, which is a geometric problem and out of scope here.
 *
 * ⚠ NO PRODUCTION CALLER YET. This is the pure core of an L-sized finding; the Blender
 * application half is specified, not built. Do not read its presence as "PoF conforms rigs".
