/**
 * World-scale grading — holds a generated mesh to a real-world SIZE, the way
 * `face-budget.ts` holds it to a triangle budget.
 *
 * Every image/text→3D generator PoF runs normalises its output to a unit box: the
 * longest bounding-box extent comes back as ~1.0 (glTF metres) regardless of what the
 * asset is. Measured 2026-08-17 over every `.glb` under `generated/`: the Tripo-cloud
 * hero `jinx.glb` is 1.000 m tall, `props__crate.glb` 1.000 m, `saber_hilt.glb`
 * 1.017 m LONG, every TripoSR best-of ~1.0. Nothing downstream corrected it — the
 * import template defaults `scale: 1.0`, the Tier-1 gate only rejected a DEGENERATE box,
 * and mesh-finish never rescales — so a hero shipped at 100 cm next to a 180 cm
 * Mannequin and a sword hilt at a metre. The pro workflow's fix is manual (export the
 * UE reference skeleton into Blender "for size reference"); this module is the
 * automated version: measure, compare, and hand back the `ImportUniformScale` that
 * would make the delivery the size it was supposed to be.
 *
 * Honesty rules (the project's dominant one):
 *  - no target ⇒ `unmeasured`, never `matches` — silence must not read as compliance;
 *  - a class gets a nominal size only where one is HONEST (a character = the UE5
 *    Mannequin); a prop can be a coin or a wagon, so no class-wide number is invented;
 *  - the correction factor is reported even on a match, so callers can always apply it.

 * Orientation — is the asset standing up, or lying on its side?
 *
 * Found by the render gate on 2026-08-31 (`docs/research/kit-render-gate-spec.md`):
 * every TripoSR asset checked is authored LYING DOWN. `bestof_fg070.glb` measures
 * 0.95 x 0.50 x 0.52 — its longest axis is X, not up — and the renders show a chair on
 * its side. Nothing caught it. The Tier-1 gate only rejects a DEGENERATE bbox, and
 * `gradeWorldScale` above compares the LONGEST extent against a target, so for a chair
 * lying down it holds the sideways length to the intended height and reports a scale
 * that is confidently wrong.
 *
 * This is the cheapest possible check — it needs no new measurement, only the bbox the
 * critique already emits — and it is the difference between shipping an asset at the
 * wrong size and shipping it on its side at the wrong size.
 *
 * THE PRESCRIPTION IS VERIFIED, NOT INFERRED. `chair.glb` measures [1.069, 0.569, 0.599]
 * and this grade prescribes +90° about Z; applying exactly that rotation and re-measuring
 * through `pof_mesh_critique.py` gives [0.569, 1.069, 0.599] — X and Y swapped, the up
 * axis now dominant, verdict `upright`.
 *
 * Note WHY the reason says "before import". That verification was done by transforming
 * the mesh data in Blender and re-exporting, and the round trip shattered the mesh:
 * 41,862 verts became 250,877 and one connected component became 83,576. The rotation
 * was right and the delivery mechanism was not. Apply this as an IMPORT-TIME rotation
 * (the UE importer's rotation, beside `ImportUniformScale`), exactly as a scale miss is
 * corrected at import rather than by rewriting the asset.
