/**
 * Bone-group vocabulary — what a skeleton's joint NAMES tell you about its anatomy.
 *
 * ── The defect this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `rig-gate.ts` answers "can this skeleton deform this mesh?" and answers it well:
 * weights, orphans, normalization. It does not read joint names at all — its glTF
 * interface has no `nodes` field — so it cannot see WHICH bones exist. A rig with a
 * flawless weight distribution and no finger bones scores 100/pass, and the character
 * then cannot close a hand around a prop. That is not a hypothetical: it is the failure
 * that stops a generated NPC from holding a broom, and both of Tripo's humanoid rig
 * models were observed to produce it.
 *
 * ── Why names, and why this is cheap ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Joint names live in the glTF JSON chunk `rig-gate` already decodes — `nodes[i].name`
 * for each index in `skins[0].joints`. Reading them costs nothing. What it buys is the
 * whole class of ANATOMICAL questions that the gate's docstring defers to "a posed render
 * and a critique pass": a render is needed to judge whether a joint sits in a plausible
 * PLACE, but not to establish whether it EXISTS.
 *
 * ── The measurement that shaped this module ──────────────────────────────────
 * MEASURED 2026-09-07 off `src/__tests__/fixtures/rig/skintokens_cube_rigged.glb`, real
 * skin-tokens.cpp output: the joint names are `bone_0 … bone_5`. **PoF's only local rig
 * engine names nothing.** So the first thing this module must report is not a missing
 * group but an ANONYMOUS skeleton — a rig whose bones carry positional names cannot be
 * bone-group checked, cannot be mapped to an IK Retargeter chain, and cannot be conformed
 * onto a third-party clip library. "Unverifiable" is therefore a first-class answer here,
 * distinct from both pass and fail, because a group check on `bone_3` would otherwise
 * report a confident, meaningless absence.
 *
 * Tripo, by contrast, names semantically and lets the caller pick the convention: its
 * auto-rig `spec` parameter (`tripo` | `mixamo`) IS a bone-naming spec. That is why
 * {@link classifyNaming} distinguishes the two — a downstream conform step needs to know
 * which vocabulary it received.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free: tokenization plus set lookups, so it is callable from the
 * gate, from an acceptance checker, and from a script without any of them paying for it.
