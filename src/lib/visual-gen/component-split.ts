/**
 * Parts vs specks — the node-free half of the Tier-1 mesh gate's component reasoning.

 * Lives apart from `mesh-critique.ts` (which spawns the trimesh script and so imports
 * `node:fs` / `node:path`) because the UE import plan (`ue-import-plan.ts`) counts shells
 * with it, and that plan is rendered by a client component (Import Automation). Moving the
 * rule here keeps ONE authority for "what is a part" without pulling node:* into the browser
 * bundle. `mesh-critique.ts` re-exports everything below, so its importers are unchanged.
