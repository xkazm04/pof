/**
 * Face-budget unit + honoured-budget grading.
 *
 * A polygon budget is meaningless without its unit, and PoF had been carrying one
 * number ("40k faces") across three layers that each mean something different by it:
 *
 *  - `polycount-presets.ts` authors the budget with no unit stated;
 *  - a provider's `face_limit` counts the faces it is asked to emit — and in QUAD mode
 *    a face is a quad, so the same 40k number delivers ~80k triangles;
 *  - `mesh-critique.ts` measures through trimesh, which triangulates on load, so every
 *    measurement is in TRIANGLES.
 *
 * The failure this produces is not hypothetical: a controlled retopology test
 * ("10 Minutes vs 10 Hours", 2026-08-14) commissioned a 15K budget, received 15K QUADS,
 * and only caught it at review — "I should have said 15K triangles". The same source
 * showed a provider ignoring a low-poly request entirely and returning 150K.
 *
 * So this module does two things, both pure:
 *  1. fixes ONE authored unit (triangles) and converts explicitly at the provider edge;
 *  2. grades what was actually DELIVERED against what was REQUESTED — a check nothing
 *     performed, because the class gate only ever compared against its own `warnAbove`
 *     ceiling, never against the budget the caller asked for.
 *
 * Honesty rule (the project's dominant one): a missing measurement or a missing request
 * yields `unmeasured`, never `honored`. Silence must not read as compliance.
