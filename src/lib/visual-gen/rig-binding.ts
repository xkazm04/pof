/**
 * Rig binding — can THIS rig be animated on THAT target skeleton?
 *
 * Three modules each answered a third of that question and none composed the others:
 * `rig-gate.ts` reads a produced rig's joint names but knew no target; `rig-presets.ts`
 * knows the targets but only checked its own hand-authored table; `bone-conform.ts` maps
 * any semantic vocabulary onto any other but had no production caller. Measured before
 * this module: a 14-bone biped named Hips/Spine/Neck/Head/Left|Right Arm/ForeArm/Hand/
 * Leg/Foot scored 100/pass at the gate while 4 of the UE5 Mannequin's 10 required chain
 * endpoints had no bone in it — both arm chains and both leg chains would not retarget.
 *
 * {@link bindRigToPreset} is the one verdict. It resolves the source convention from the
 * rig's ACTUAL names, never from what the table claims about itself:
 *
 *  - Mixamo names onto a remap target with a table → `table`. The table stays the single
 *    owner of that mapping; a row counts only when its source bone is really in the rig.
 *  - Any other semantic names → `derived`, via {@link planConform} onto the target's
 *    vocabulary, keeping the planner's exact / canonical / chain-order audit labels.
 *  - Anonymous, empty or uncaptured names → `unverifiable` (never `bound`).
 *  - A conform target → `not-applicable`: the template ships its own skeleton.
 *
 * An unbound required chain endpoint is a limb that will not animate, so the gate treats
 * `partial` as a hard failure (see `scoreRig` in `rig-gate.ts`). Pure.
