## Known UE Pitfalls
- **a Runtime module touching FEditorDelegates/GEditor/FAssetTools must be #if WITH_EDITOR-guarded** — Editor-only symbols (FEditorDelegates, GEditor, FAssetTools) referenced from a Runtime module break the Shipping build. Guard them with #if WITH_EDITOR or move them to an Editor module. (vertical-slice: characters)
- **GAS: model damage as a server-only META attribute, apply via GameplayEffect, clamp in PostGameplayEffectExecute — never SetHealth directly** — Route ALL attribute changes through GameplayEffects (so prediction/stacking/calc work) — never call the attribute setter directly. Model damage as a meta attribute (server-only, not replicated): a GE adds to Damage; in PostGameplayEffectExecute, read Damage, reset it to 0, subtract from Health, and clamp Health to [0, MaxHealth] (clamp in PreAttributeChange too). Health/MaxHealth ARE replicated. (research: GAS in 20 minutes (Danny Goodayle))
- **GAS: replicated attributes need GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY in OnRep; Gameplay Cues are COSMETIC ONLY** — Each replicated attribute needs an OnRep_ that calls GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY(USet, Attribute) — without it the ASC never sees replicated value changes. Use the ATTRIBUTE_ACCESSORS macro set for the getter/setter/init. Gameplay Cues are for COSMETIC feedback only (VFX/SFX/shader), keyed by gameplay tag — never put gameplay logic in a cue. (research: GAS in 20 minutes (Danny Goodayle))
- **Motion Matching: anims need root motion even w/o capsule root motion; the Phase channel CRASHES the editor; tune cost bias carefully** — Source anims in a Pose Search database need root motion ENABLED even when the capsule is driven by velocity (not root motion) — the pose search scores foot velocity/position from it. Do NOT enable the Phase channel in the pose-search schema — it crashes the editor and keeps crashing on reopen. Collected bones (pose history) must match the bones in the pose channel. Do not lower Continuing Pose Cost Bias too far (the character becomes unresponsive / sticks in one animation); if a Chooser will not leave a loop DB for a stop DB, lower the stop DB base cost bias. Reduce foot sliding with a SMALL play-rate window (~0.75-1.25, not 0.5-1.5) or Dead Blending; be cautious with mirroring (foot sliding / tilt). Use Exclude-From-Database (not a manual cut) to drop T-posed lead frames. (research: Motion Matching Problems & Solutions (Unreal DevOP))
- **GAS: build an ability one coupled piece at a time (tag → input → effect → ability → grant/bind → cue), not the whole system in one shot** — A single GAS ability spans several tightly-coupled pieces — a Gameplay Tag, an Input Action + input-config mapping, one or more GameplayEffects, the UGameplayAbility subclass, ASC granting + input binding, and (cosmetic) Gameplay Cues. One-shotting an entire ability (or a multi-ability system) in one pass reliably yields partially-wired, non-activating results: an ability that is never granted, an input that never triggers it, or an effect that never applies — all of which compile 'clean' and fail silently at runtime. Author incrementally and verify each layer before adding the next: create the tag + input and confirm the binding fires; grant the ability and confirm it activates; add the effect and confirm the attribute actually changes; then layer cues/UI. Prefer many small, individually-verified steps over one large generation. (research: Aura the Unreal AI Agent (tryoura.dev))
- **Pick failure severity by consequence: cosmetic load failures warn-and-continue; gameplay-invariant violations hard-fail — and never fabricate the missing object to keep running** — When generated code handles a failed load or lookup, choose severity by what the failure breaks, not by habit. A COSMETIC asset that fails (a mesh, VFX, audio cue) should log a warning and continue — stopping everyone because pretty_tree_03 didn't load is wrong. A GAMEPLAY-INVARIANT violation must hard-fail fast (check(), UE_LOG Fatal, or ensure + early-return): the classic case is a locked door/gate actor failing to spawn — the dungeon behind it assumes quest state that 'cannot' be missing, so warn-and-continue surfaces days later as an inexplicable bug in unrelated code, downstream of the real cause. And never 'fix' a failure by fabricating the missing state (constructing an empty list/table/object so execution can proceed) — that converts a loud caller bug into silent corruption. (research: T. Cain code standards (WildStar/Outer Worlds notes))
- **a client-visible change needs BOTH a replicated source property (DOREPLIFETIME) and an OnRep — an OnRep alone updates nothing, and controller-local state needs an IsLocalController guard** — The single largest class of structurally-plausible-but-wrong generated UE C++. Two halves, and generated code reliably writes one without the other. (1) SOURCE STATE: adding UFUNCTION() OnRep_X and marking a property ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_X does nothing unless the property is ALSO registered in GetLifetimeReplicatedProps with DOREPLIFETIME(AClass, X) and the actor/component actually replicates (bReplicates, plus SetIsReplicated(true) on a component). It compiles, the server mutates the value, the HUD never moves, and nothing errors — so a build-only gate passes it. Mutate replicated state on the SERVER only (HasAuthority()); a client-side write is overwritten on the next update. (2) LOCALITY: state belonging to ONE player — an open menu, a browsing index, local playback, an input-mode change, a camera shake — must be guarded by IsLocalController() (controller) / IsLocallyControlled() (pawn), or it runs on the wrong controller instance. RPC direction is the same check: a Server RPC needs WithValidation and runs on the server, a Client RPC targets one owning connection, a Multicast reaches everyone — a cosmetic cue is Multicast, never a replicated gameplay property. VERIFY BY RUNNING: a listen-server PIE session with 2 clients is what exposes this, which is why a build-green replication change is unproven. (research: GameEngineBench (arXiv 2607.03525) — recurring authority/replication failure class across 110 runtime-verified UE5 tasks)
- **the constructor runs at CDO time (no world, no other actors) — defaults there, wiring in BeginPlay, and every BeginPlay acquisition needs its EndPlay release** — The second recurring structural failure class in generated UE C++, and it is an ORDERING bug rather than a syntax one. The constructor executes when the Class Default Object is built — during cook and editor load, before any world exists — so it may only set defaults, create subobjects (CreateDefaultSubobject) and attach components. Anything touching the world, other actors, the game mode, a subsystem, replicated data or an asset load belongs in BeginPlay (or PostInitializeComponents / OnRegister for component wiring); in the constructor it either crashes the cook or silently bakes a stale value into the CDO that every instance shares. Activation timing is the same trap from the other side: a component created but never activated (bAutoActivate false with no Activate()), a timer set before the subsystem it calls exists, or a delegate bound in the constructor to an actor that has not spawned — all compile, all do nothing. TEARDOWN MUST BE SYMMETRIC: every BeginPlay acquisition — AddDynamic bindings, SetTimer handles, spawned actors, registrations with a subsystem or manager — needs its release in EndPlay (and call Super::EndPlay), or a PIE session leaks it into the NEXT one and the second run of the same test behaves differently from the first. That is exactly the shared-world hazard the functional-test rule names: state surviving EndPlay is state the next test inherits. (research: GameEngineBench (arXiv 2607.03525) — constructor-default / activation-timing / teardown failure cluster)
- **save/load, streaming and spawning are ONE contract — a persistence change that touches only the save struct silently loses destroyed actors and streamed-in state** — The hardest unsolved class in the runtime-verified benchmark: the tasks no agent configuration solved needed coordination BETWEEN runtime systems rather than any single API call, and persistence is the canonical case. A correct save/load pass keeps five things consistent at once. (1) STABLE ACTOR IDENTITY across sessions — a name or GUID that survives a reload, never a pointer, an array index or spawn order. (2) DESTROYED actors recorded EXPLICITLY, because a level reload respawns everything the map placed and an absent entry reads as 'still alive'. (3) The serialized property set matching the class as it is TODAY — add a SaveGame-tagged field and old saves must still load, so version the struct and handle the missing field rather than invalidating every existing save. (4) LEVEL STREAMING order — an actor in a sublevel that has not streamed in yet cannot be restored when the save is applied; restore on the level-loaded callback, not on BeginPlay of the persistent level. (5) The SAVE/LOAD LIFECYCLE itself — an async AsyncSaveGameToSlot completing after the actor that requested it was torn down. Write the change against all five or the feature is correct in a single fresh session and wrong on the second load, which is precisely the shape a one-shot smoke test cannot see. The same 'several systems must agree' warning applies to inventory-to-UI, ability-to-animation and streaming-to-AI changes.

## Domain Context
You are helping implement game logic systems including state machines, scoring, and win/lose conditions in UE5 C++ for an action RPG. Focus on melee attack combos, hit detection, damage calculation, and combat state management.

## Task: Feature Review for "Combat"

Scan the project source code and determine the implementation status of each feature listed below.

### Features to Check
1. **Hit detection** [Combat]: Sweep-based melee hit detection
2. **Damage application** [Combat]: GE-driven damage

### Instructions
1. For each feature, search Source/PoF/ for relevant C++ classes, headers, and config.
2. Determine the status:
   - **implemented**: Feature is fully present and functional code exists
   - **partial**: Some parts exist but incomplete (e.g., class exists but methods are empty)
   - **missing**: No evidence of this feature in the codebase
   - **unknown**: Cannot determine
3. Record file paths (relative to project root) that contain the implementation.
4. Write brief review notes explaining your assessment.
5. Assign a **qualityScore** from 1 to 5 measuring production readiness:
   - **1**: Stub / placeholder only — no real logic
   - **2**: Basic skeleton — compiles but lacks core behavior
   - **3**: Functional — works for basic cases, needs polish
   - **4**: Solid — handles edge cases, good structure, minor gaps
   - **5**: Pro / production-grade — robust, optimized, follows UE best practices
   For missing features, use `null`.
6. Write **nextSteps**: a concise list of what is needed to reach quality 5 (pro-grade). Focus on concrete actions: missing methods, unhandled edge cases, performance gaps, best practices not yet followed. For features already at 5, write "None — production ready." For missing features, describe what needs to be built from scratch.

### Rules
- Do NOT modify any project files — this is a read-only review.
- Do NOT use TodoWrite or Task/Explore tools.
- Do NOT write any files to disk — submit results using the callback format below.

Include ALL features from the list, even if missing. Use the EXACT featureName strings.
